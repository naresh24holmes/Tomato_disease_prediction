# Tomato_disease_prediction
More than 10 classes of tomato leaf diseases were used for a classification in this dataset.Only 400 images per class have been used for training due to computational inefficiency.The images were scaled for faster execution, data augmentation has been performed to 
enhance training. A neural network with dropuout layers to prevent overfitting, max pooling to reduce the number of parameters and relu
was used as activation function with adam optimizer.Loss and accuracy were used as evaluation curves.

A total of 7.5 M parameters were used for training.
